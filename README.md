# Seeker of Magic

By Garry Francis

## Background

You are Rowan of Bunglewood Downs, would-be thief and seeker of magic.

There's known to be a Cave of Magic deep in the forest of Bunglewood. The cave is not hard to find, but no one goes there for fear of being eaten by a troll. As no one's been there, no one knows for sure what's in the cave. It's rumoured to contain treasure, but if it contains treasure, why isn't it called 'The Cave of Treasure'?

No, you suspect that the cave contains magic. There's only one way to find out for sure and that's to go there!

This is a traditional text adventure that was originally written for the [Adventuron CaveJam](https://itch.io/jam/cavejam), 31 August to 23 September 2019. The game can be played at [Seeker of Magic](https://warrigal.itch.io/seeker-of-magic).

## Release notes

Version 1.0.0 was written and compiled using [Adventuron Classroom](https://adventuron.io/classroom/) 1.0.0 beta 6. You may need to make changes if using a later version of Adventuron.
